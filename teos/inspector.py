# FIXME: The inspector logs the wrong messages sent form the users. A possible attack surface would be to send a really
#        long field that, even if not accepted by TEOS, would be stored in the logs. This is a possible DoS surface
#        since teos would store any kind of message (no matter the length). Solution: truncate the length of the fields
#        stored + blacklist if multiple wrong requests are received.
