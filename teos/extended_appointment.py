        encrypted_blob (:obj:`str`): An encrypted blob of data containing a penalty transaction. The tower will decrypt
            it and broadcast the penalty transaction upon seeing a breach on the blockchain.
        to_self_delay (:obj:`int`): The ``to_self_delay`` encoded in the ``csv`` of the ``to_remote`` output of the
            commitment transaction that this appointment is covering.
